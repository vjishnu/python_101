Go to http://notepad-plus-plus.org with your browser, get the Notepad++ text editor, and install it. You do not need to be the administrator to do this.  
1.	Make sure you can get to Notepad++ easily by putting it on your desktop and/or in Quick Launch. Both options are available during setup.  
2.	Run PowerShell from the Start menu. Search for it and you can just hit Enter to run it.  
3.	Make a shortcut to it on your desktop and/or Quick Launch for your convenience.  
4.	Run your Terminal program. It won’t look like much.  
5.	In your Terminal program, run python. You run things in Terminal by just typing the name and hitting Enter. 
6.	If you run python and it’s not there (python is not recognized.), install it from  http://python.org/download.  
7.	Make sure you install Python 3.  
8.	You may be better off with Active State Python, especially if you do not have administrative rights.  
9.	If after you install it python still isn’t recognized, then in PowerShell enter this:  
a.	[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27", "User")  
b.	Close PowerShell and then start it again to make sure Python now runs. If it doesn’t, restart may be required. 
10. Type quit() and hit Enter to exit python.
